# Data_structure_based_on_chain_table

I wrote down what I learned here not only to share with you but to encourage me to keep coding.

In this file, I wrote down some basic chain table functions, including 'length', 'insert',etc.
And I didn't finish right now.
As a beginner in data structure, there must be many mistakes in my codes.
I sincerely hope that you can point out my mistakes.

TO ALL WHO ARE TRYING TO CODE!

TO FUTURE!
